# RandomCSharpPractice
This repository just has some scripts of me learning C#. There are many different things going on (it's quite messy!) and I mainly use this project to keep all my tests and practice in the same place.

Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions that I should try out, or things that would be a good idea to learn.

(EDIT: Repo hasn't been uploaded yet)
